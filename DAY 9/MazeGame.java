/* Design and develop a maze game application where each entry point into the maze can have multiple input paths but restricted exit paths. Store each entry point along with its number of exits and use a sorting algorithm (e.g., Insertion or Selection Sort) to sort the entries based on the number of exits. Highlight the most and least restricted entries in the sorted output. */
